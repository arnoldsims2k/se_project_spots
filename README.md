# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project was made with the emphasis on learning how to use Responsive and Adaptive Web Design. Its intended to teach and demonstrate how to build a webpage that displays correctly regardless of what screen size you're looking at from mobile phones to desktops and continue to display correctly.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

In the video, i discuss my experience and what technologies were used to make my project 3. This particular project was very challenging due to how new learning responsive web design is at the moment. upon making sure the file structure was correct, I began working on the html structure and had no real problem. Thoug on the CSS part I had several challenges when working to make sure the media queries were correct. I kept writing them backwards but after a review I finally undertood how they are written and was able to make the corrections to complete the assignment.
