# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project was made with the emphasis on learning how to use Responsive and Adaptive Web Design. Its intended to teach and demonstrate how to build a webpage that displays correctly regardless of what screen size you're looking at from mobile phones to desktops and continue to display correctly.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
